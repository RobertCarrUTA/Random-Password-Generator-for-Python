## About the Project
This is a simple Python script I made for generating random passwords. It offers six password generation options for the user to choose from. These options include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, special symbols, or generate a password containing letters, digits, and special characters. A password generated by this script can have a length between 8 and 256 characters.

Since I always make my passwords strong, I thought it would be a good idea to create my own strong password generator. By automating the process, I can save time. Previously, I used an online password generator, but it is no longer available. Most online password generators have too much clutter. I just want my password generated without distractions. As a result of creating this script, I, or anybody else, will be able to easily create strong passwords without all the distractions. A web-based version is eventually planned. As an extra practice exercise, I would like to make this in different languages. I would also like to make another Python password generator with a user interface to make it easier to use for less tech savy users.

## Compile Instructions
